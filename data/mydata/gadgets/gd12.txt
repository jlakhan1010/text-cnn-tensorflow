Xiaomi Redmi Snapdragon 855 flagship to be called K20, K20 Pro: Report
Redmi Snapdragon 855 powered flagship device is reported to have two variants going by the name K20 and K20 Pro. The real image of the phone has also been spotted online.
Redmi’s Snapdragon 855 flagship smartphone is one of the most anticipated devices of the year. There have been reports suggesting that there will be not one but two flagship smartphones. Recently, Redmi General Manager Lu Weibing teased the name of one of the models on Weibo and we can safely assume that it will be called the Redmi K20.

Weibing took to Weibo to give users four options to guess the name of the new Redmi flagship. These included X20, P20, K20 and T20. Considering a recent leak where a protective cover of a smartphone going by the name Redmi K20 Pro was spotted with Snapdragon 855 processor, it appears that K20 is the right answer to Weibing’s quiz.

Additionally, tipsters Ishan Agarwal revealed that Redmi Flagship phone will have two variants and their names will be Redmi K20 and K20 Pro. He also revealed the storage models of the two phones as 6GB/64GB, 6GB/128GB, 8GB/256GB for the K20 and 6GB/64GB, 6GB/128GB, 8GB/128GB, 8GB/256GB for the K20 Pro.
