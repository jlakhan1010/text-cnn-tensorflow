The bank has attributed the loss to increased provisions on NPAs and fraud accounts especially due to backdating of NPAs — with one big account being declared as fraud.

The impact of these two events have been pegged at around Rs 2,150 crore on the provisions, the bank said in a statement. Sequentially, in the third quarter, IOB had posted a net loss of Rs 346.02 crore.

The total income of the bank, which has been plagued by mounting bad assets and consequent losses for quite some time for now, witnessed a 5.876 per cent drop in Q4 at Rs 5,474 crore as against Rs 5,689 crore.
In a statement, IOB said it posted an operating profit of Rs 5,034crore, the highest in eight decades, while its CASA hit an all-time high of 38.30 per cent.

However, both sequentially and year-on-year, the bank has seen some reprieve on the asset quality front. —FE

The airline owes its lenders around Rs 8,500 crore and had to shut down operations after banks failed to arrive at a consensus on extending fresh funding to keep it afloat. Bankers are now awaiting binding offers from potential acquirers for the airline, who have not been forthcoming so far. The deadline for sending in binding offers is Friday.

In April, eight parties had put in bids for Jet. Apart from Jet’s 24 per cent equity partner Etihad Airways, other major parties to have put in bids were US-based private equity firms TPG and Indigo Partners, which had bid separately, and Think Equity Partner and Redcliffe Capital, who had put in a joint bid.

Banks have already begun to make provisions against their exposure to Jet. —FE
